        <h3>Take part in the Festival</h3>
        <p>
          From September 11th – 15th 2023, coworking spaces in Berlin and Brandenburg will open their doors and invite
          the public to personally experience coworking. It’s an opportunity to engage with the wider community and
          demonstrate what so many professionals around the world have already figured out: Coworking is not only here
          to stay, it is redefining our relationship with work.
